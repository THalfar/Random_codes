# Random_codes
This repo contains codes from my study days at Tampere University of Technology.

These are indeed old codes from over the years. Now, looking back after all this time, I realize there's much room for improvement. However, I'm sharing the codes as they are to give some insight into my development journey.

- 'sudoku_AC3_ratkaisija.py' - This code was created during an artificial intelligence course. It's Sudoku solver using the AC3 algorithm. The code tests the solver's effectiveness on a Sudoku considered to be difficult.
